## About

The Footy Shirts project is a "E-commerce" of shirts created for the purpose of learning Material UI and improving other skills. Please note that this project is not a real online store and does not involve actual transactions.

The shirts displayed in this project are not owned by the creator but have been selected from the Nike.com website to showcase a variety of football shirt designs. The intention is to provide a platform for exploring different shirt styles, designs, and concepts.

Please be aware that the shirts featured in this project are for **demonstration purposes only** and should not be used for commercial purposes or misrepresentation. The rights to these shirts belong to their respective owners, typically the manufacturers and distributors.

### Technologies Used

- The project utilizes **React JS and Material UI** for the frontend development, providing an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

- **Firebase's Realtime Database** enables real-time synchronization and storage of the football shirt data.

- **Redux**, along with Redux Toolkit, is used for state management, providing a predictable and centralized data flow. React-Router is utilized for handling navigation within the application, allowing users to browse and explore different football shirt designs easily.
